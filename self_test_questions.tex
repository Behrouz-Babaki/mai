\section{Insight}

A maximal clique is a clique which is not a subset of a larger clique.

\scalebox{0.75}{
\hskip1.4cm
\begin{tikzpicture}[ugraph]
%\node[font=\Large] at (1.2,2.8) {Undirected Graph};
\node[cont] (x1) at (0,2) {$X_1$};
\node[cont] (x2) at (2,2) {$X_2$};
\node[cont] (x3) at (2,0) {$X_3$};

\begin{question}
Consider the following definitions.  
A vertical bar separates alternatives. For instance, $gray  \mid grey$ defines the set \{$gray$, $grey$\}.
Parentheses are used to define the scope and precedence of the operators (among other uses). For example, $gray \mid grey$ and $gr(a\mid e)y$ are equivalent patterns which both describe the set 
 \{$gray$, $grey$\}.
The quantifier $^*$ denotes that the previous element may be repeated zero or more times. 
 For example, $ab^*c$ includes $ac$, $abc$, $abbc$, $abbbc$, and so on.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Does the set $d (a \mid bc)^*t  $ include $dat$, $daaaaat$, $dbcabct$ ?  
\item
How would you define the set of all binary representations of natural numbers (i.e., 0, 1, 10, 11, ... ) ?
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
