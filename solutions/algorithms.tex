\textbf{Question 16.} The output of algorithm would be the array $ [3 \quad 5 \quad 7 \quad 9] $.
\textbf{Question 17.} This algorithm sorts the input array using a technique called bubble sort.
\textbf{Question 18.}  The number of iterations of the inner loop starts with value 9 and gradually decreases to 1. So the total number of comparisons is $ 9 + 8 + \ldots + 2 + 1 = 45$.

\textbf{Question 19.} For an array of length $n$, the number of iterations of inner loop starts with value $n-1$ and gradually decreases to 1. So the total number of iterations would be $(n-1) + (n-2) + \ldots + 1 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. This indicates that the running time of this algorithm is of $\Theta(n^2)$.

\textbf{Question 20.} The maximal number of nodes at depth-level $d$ of a binary tree is $2^d$. So the answer to this question is $2^4 = 16$. 

\textbf{Question 21.}
\begin{equation*}
5 \log_2^n \prec 3n \prec 7.5 n \log_2^n \prec 6n^2 \prec n^7 \prec 2^n \prec 8n!
\end{equation*}
