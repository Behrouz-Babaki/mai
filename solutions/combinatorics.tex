\textbf{Question 5.} Every handshake requires two individuals. So the total number of handshakes is equal to the number of ways that we could pick 2 individuals from a group of 15:
\begin{equation*}
\binom{15}{2} = \frac{15!}{(15 - 2)! 2!} = 105
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Question 6.} The possible ways to rank these ten answers are equal to the number of permutations of 10 object, which is $10! = 3628800$.

\textbf{Question 7.} Each subset of $\{1 , \ldots , 100\}$ which does not contain an even number is a subset of $\{1, 3, 5, \ldots , 97, 99\}$. So it would suffice to count the number of subsets of $\{1, 3, 5, \ldots , 97, 99\}$. We know that a set containing $n$ elements has $2^n$ subsets (including the empty subset). So the answer is $2^{50}$.

\textbf{Question 8.} The order is not important, hence the answer is
\begin{equation*}
\binom{10}{3} = \frac{10!}{(10-3)!3!} = 120
\end{equation*}
