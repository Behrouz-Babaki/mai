% Question 23
\begin{question}
Which of the following statements are correct?
\begin{solution}
\begin{multiple-choice}
\choice[correct]{not(A and B) is true whenever A is false or B is false}
\choice[correct]{not (A or B) is true if and only if (not A and not B) is true}
\choice{not (A or B) is true if and only if  (not A or not B) is true}
\choice[correct]{not (A and B) is true whenever A is false}
\end{multiple-choice}
\end{solution}
\end{question}

% Question 24
\begin{question}
Simplify the following boolean expression: \\
(A and B) or (A and B and C) or (A and B and C) or (A and B and C and D) or (A and B and C and D).
\begin{solution}
% TODO (Behrouz) There should be a better way of doing this
% The answer is \answer{A and B}. 
\begin{multiple-choice}
\choice[correct]{A and B}
\choice{A or B}
\choice{(not A) or B}
\choice{A or (not B)}
\choice{(not A) and B}
\choice{A and (not B)}
\choice{A implies B}
\choice{B implies A}
\end{multiple-choice}
\end{solution}
\end{question}

% Question 25
\begin{question}
Is the following boolean expression satisfiable, i.e., is there an
assignment to the variables $A$ and $B$ so that the following
expression evaluates to true?  \\ \\ A or (not A and B) or (not A and
not B and C)\\ \\ If so, state one.
\begin{solution}
% TODO (Behrouz) This way of presenting the answer reveals the answer to the first part. Fix it!
% TODO (Behrouz) This is not a correct specification of solution; as any assignment to B and C would be also valid. Is there a way to specify more than one correct answer?
By assigning value \answer{true} to \emph{A} and \answer{false} to \emph{B} and \answer{false} to \emph{C}, the equation evaluates to true.
\end{solution}
\end{question}
